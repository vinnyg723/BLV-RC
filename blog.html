                                            DESIGNATIONS FOR 2014</h2>
                                        <p>ARLINGTON, Virginia – The Road Runners Club of America (RRCA) is pleased to
                                            announce the first round of Runner Friendly Community designations for 2014,
                                            which includes: Belleville, IL; Richmond, VA; Rockwall, TX; Safety Harbor,
                                            FL and Spokane, WA.<br><br>
                                            These communities have shown that they meet the program’s criteria, which
                                            includes community infrastructure, community support, and local government
                                            support for running. Each community has an infrastructure that can foster
                                            physical activity in a safe environment. They have a proven track record
                                            that organizations and businesses work together to promote running as a
                                            healthy exercise and sport. With the most important criteria being, there
                                            are positive relationships between the running community and local
                                            government.<br><br>
                                            The goal of the RRCA’s Runner Friendly Community program is to shine a
                                            national spotlight on communities that standout as runner-friendly and
                                            provide incentives and ideas for communities to work towards becoming runner
                                            friendly communities. Runner Friendly Communities can also increase the
                                            quality of life, improve physical activity for residents as outlined in the
                                            National Physical Activity Plan, and provide for increased economic impact
                                            for the community.br><br><br>
                                            Congratulations to the following RUNNER FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES:<br><br>

                                                In 1907, Spokane’s board of park commissioners retained the services of
